## **The IXL Experience: What Users Are Saying?**

Let’s hear from some of the amazing IXL reviews I found online, which will help you decide better on choosing the platform.

User [r/homeschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) on Reddit

“I use Reading Eggs, but am looking for a digital app that would give my kids English and math review on the side. IXL seems to offer both, and it looks like they have plenty of curriculum. They do not use a trail, so I am asking before I sign up. I already have an unhealthy amount of worksheet site subscriptions…”

User [mjolnir76](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) on Reddit -

In my experience as a private math tutor (and 8 years as a public school math teacher), IXL is fine for reinforcement of math topics but is not a great initial teaching tool. Maybe it has changed since I last used it, but I wouldn’t recommend it as the primary teaching method

User [bythewar](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/ymcuzs/ixl_worth_getting_or_pass/?rdt=42175) On Reddit -

I like IXL. When working on a concept, it’s pretty easy to score a 90/100. However, the final ten points require true mastery of the content. Missing the last few questions can knock you back, but it’s not hard to get to 90.
