Before I found the Linux Foundation, I had used some other platforms as well, like KodeKloud.

However, I must say I was impressed with the easy-to-navigate interface of the website and its structured learning course videos.

![Linux Foudation official website](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a35d108f-f8d8-465a-90e0-7a98bc7b0cdc)

Each course is well-designed, which helps me to grasp even complicated topics easily.

### If You Pass, You Get Certified

You will get a certificate if you pass the exam, Linux Foundation does not just give you a piece of paper.

Their test and exams are highly competitive, and if you get a certification fromthe Linux Foundation, it is recognized worldwide.

Since the Linux Foundation is a well-known name in open-source technology.

The Linux Foundation gives a direct pathway to certification; that is, whenever I completed a course, I had to undertake a [proctored exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/blog/proctoring-for-linux-foundation-certification-exams-explained/).

Only if I pass the proctored exam then I get eligible for a certificate from the Linux Foundation, which will even enhance the credibility.

### A Beginner's Guide to Open Source Development

As I was a complete beginner to open-source development, the very first course I took on the Linux Foundation was ‘Introduction to Open Source Development’.

And I will suggest it to you too if you are a complete beginner like I was.
