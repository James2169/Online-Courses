## Alternative Ways To Save On Coursera

### 1. Coursera Plus Financial Aid: Get 90% of Fees Waived

Coursera also offers a financial aid program for those who may need assistance in accessing the platform.

Eligible learners can apply for financial aid and receive [**up to 90%**](https://imp.i384100.net/XmyPEa) of the course fees waived, making Coursera Plus even more accessible.

### 2. Coursera Audit Courses

The majority of Coursera's resources are available to you [**for free**](https://imp.i384100.net/XmyPEa) when you audit a course.

But if obtaining a credential is truly important to you, then just pay for it.

However, you may subsequently need to complete additional coursework that is typically not part of the audit program.
